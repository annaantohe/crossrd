  aiNarrative: "AI translation tools and data analytics will change embassy operations, but diplomacy is fundamentally about human relationships — reading a room, building trust with foreign counterparts, and negotiating under pressure.

  aiNarrative: "AI can already summarize legislation, run regression analyses, and draft policy memos faster than humans. But understanding political feasibility, stakeholder dynamics, and translating data into actionable recommendations still requires human judgment — though the entry-level research grunt work is shrinking."
  fellowshipOptions: "MPA/MPP from top programs (Harvard Kennedy, Princeton WWS, Georgetown), PMF (Presidential Management Fellowship), AAAS Science Policy Fellowship"

  aiNarrative: "Budget scoring and economic modeling are squarely in AI's wheelhouse — CBO-style microsimulation and cost estimates could be dramatically accelerated by AI. But interpreting results, explaining tradeoffs to Members of Congress in plain English, and maintaining the nonpartisan credibility that makes CBO matter are human skills."
  fellowshipOptions: "PhD or MA in Economics/Public Policy, CBO Fellowship, Brookings Economic Studies, NBER affiliation"
