  aiNarrative: "AI can already scan thousands of transactions for errors faster than a team of associates. But someone still needs to understand the business, talk to management, and make judgment calls on gray areas — that's where the auditor stays relevant. Expect the role to shift toward supervising AI tools rather than ticking boxes yourself."

  aiNarrative: "Tax software keeps getting smarter, and AI can already handle straightforward returns. But the US tax code is absurdly complicated, and businesses need humans who can find legal ways to save money on taxes. The seasonal crunch (Jan-Apr) is brutal, but the rest of the year is more chill."

  aiNarrative: "AI is actually your best friend here — it helps you scan millions of transactions to find the suspicious ones. But figuring out if someone is lying, following money through shell companies, and testifying in court? That's pure human judgment. Forensic accounting is one of the most AI-resistant finance careers."

  aiNarrative: "AI will automate a lot of the routine bookkeeping and reporting that controllers oversee, but the role is really about being the financial gatekeeper of a company. You're the one making sure the numbers are right before the CEO sees them. That accountability and judgment doesn't automate easily."
  fellowshipOptions: "CMA (management accounting), MBA, CGMA (global management)"
  compModel: "Base salary + annual bonus tied to company performance"

  aiNarrative: "FP&A directors and CFOs are the strategic brains behind a company's money decisions. AI gives you better forecasting tools, but deciding whether to acquire a company, raise prices, or cut a product line requires business instinct and leadership. This is one of the safest finance careers from AI disruption."

  aiNarrative: "Quant funds already use AI to trade, and it's only getting more powerful. But managing a portfolio isn't just math — it's about understanding markets, managing risk during a crisis, and making calls when models disagree. The best portfolio managers combine data skills with gut instincts developed over years."

  aiNarrative: "AI can crunch earnings reports and screen stocks in seconds, which honestly threatens the data-gathering part of this job. But the real value is the deep industry knowledge — knowing why a CEO's strategy will fail or why a new drug will change a company. That creative, skeptical thinking is hard to automate."
  fellowshipOptions: "CFA (strongly expected), CPA (useful for accounting knowledge), sector-specific certs"
  compModel: "Base salary + year-end bonus (often 50-100% of base at senior levels)"

  aiNarrative: "Robo-advisors like Betterment and Wealthfront already manage basic investing for cheap. But when someone inherits $2 million, goes through a divorce, or is planning for retirement, they want a real human to talk to. The relationship and trust side of this job is nearly impossible to automate."
  fellowshipOptions: "CFP (common complement), CFA, ChFC (chartered financial consultant), CPWA (private wealth)"
  compModel: "Fee-based or commission-based; can build to $200K+ with a book of clients. AUM-based fees (0.5-1% of assets managed)"

  aiRiskMedium: 5
  aiRiskLong: 6
  aiNarrative: "AI can build better predictive models, which is kind of what actuaries do. But the job is really about understanding risk in a way that regulators, executives, and clients trust. You'll use AI as a tool to build better models, not get replaced by it. Plus, the exam process (7-10 exams over 5-7 years) creates a massive barrier to entry that protects the profession."
  fellowshipOptions: "FSA (life/health track) or FCAS (property/casualty track), CERA (enterprise risk), predictive analytics cert"
  compModel: "Base salary + exam raise bonuses ($5-15K per exam passed) + annual bonus. Steady progression tied to exams"

  dailyWorkflow: "Building pricing models, analyzing claims data, reserve calculations, regulatory filings, presenting to underwriters"

  aiNarrative: "Apps can make a basic financial plan, but they can't sit across from a couple arguing about money and help them figure out their priorities. Financial planning is deeply personal — it's about goals, fears, and life transitions. If you're good with people and like solving puzzles, AI will be a tool that makes you better, not a threat."
  fellowshipOptions: "CFA, ChFC, CLU (insurance), RICP (retirement income), AEP (estate planning)"
