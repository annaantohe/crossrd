  aiNarrative: "AI accelerates genomics, bioinformatics, and image analysis but cannot replace the wet-lab experimental design, organism-level thinking, and mentorship that define biology professorships. You still need someone to ask the right questions and interpret surprising results."

  aiNarrative: "AI helps with molecular modeling and reaction prediction, but synthesis is fundamentally hands-on. You can't computationally create a new molecule — someone has to stand at the fume hood. Chemistry professors who embrace computational tools alongside wet chemistry will thrive."

  aiNarrative: "CS professors are at the epicenter of the AI revolution — many are building the tools themselves. The field evolves so fast that staying current is exhausting, but it also means constant demand for people who can teach and research the next thing. Industry consulting creates a lucrative safety net."
  fellowshipOptions: Postdoc 1-2yr (shorter than other fields); sabbatical every 7yr; endowed chairs; industry sabbaticals at FAANG common

  aiNarrative: "AI-generated text is the elephant in the room for English departments. Professors must rethink writing pedagogy, but close reading, literary interpretation, and critical theory require the kind of nuanced human thinking AI struggles with. The irony is that AI makes teaching writing harder while making the skills English professors teach more important."

  aiNarrative: "Philosophy of mind, ethics, and logic are suddenly hot because of AI — who better to think about machine consciousness, algorithmic bias, and the ethics of autonomous systems?

  aiNarrative: "Large language models have made linguistics suddenly relevant to the tech industry — understanding how language works is crucial for improving AI. Computational linguistics PhDs can command industry salaries, while field linguists documenting endangered languages do work AI cannot replicate. The field is splitting into high-demand computational and niche theoretical tracks."
  fellowshipOptions: Postdoc 1-2yr; sabbatical every 7yr; named chairs; NSF/NEH fellowships; endangered language documentation grants
  compModel: 9-month academic salary + summer research funding; NSF/NEH grants; computational linguists have industry consulting options

  aiNarrative: "Education research is about understanding how humans learn — and AI is creating a natural experiment in real time as schools adopt AI tutoring tools. Researchers who can evaluate these interventions are in growing demand. Classroom observation, qualitative research, and working with school districts require human presence and trust."

  aiNarrative: "Biomedical research is fundamentally wet-lab work — cell culture, animal models, clinical trials. AI helps with drug target identification and image analysis, but the bench science that validates discoveries cannot be automated. The long postdoc pipeline and grant pressure make this path demanding, but the potential to save lives is real."
  fellowshipOptions: Postdoc 2-5yr required (notoriously long); sabbatical every 7yr; named chairs; NIH K-awards bridge to independence
  compModel: 12-month research appointment (not 9-month); NIH/foundation grants; postdoc salaries notoriously low ($55K-65K)
