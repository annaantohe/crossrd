  aiNarrative: "Lab automation is real and accelerating — robotic pipetting, automated sample processing, and AI-driven analysis are reducing the number of hands needed for routine assays. But someone still has to troubleshoot equipment, prepare non-standard samples, and handle the weird stuff that breaks protocol."
  fellowshipOptions: "MS in biology/chemistry for advancement; lab manager track; specialized certifications (ASCP, MLT)"
  compModel: "Hourly or salaried; university, hospital, or private lab positions"
  revPerPatientVisit: "N/A — salaried/grant-funded"

  aiNarrative: "AI automates some routine analysis — cleaning data, running standard models, generating charts — but paradoxically creates even more work for data scientists who can frame research questions, interpret messy real-world data, and communicate findings to non-technical stakeholders. The job is evolving fast, not disappearing."

AI can help with DNA matching algorithms and pattern recognition, but a judge and jury need a human expert to explain the evidence. The legal system keeps this role very safe from automation."
