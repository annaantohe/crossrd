  aiNarrative: "Pre-K teaching is almost entirely about human connection — building social-emotional skills, managing toddler behavior, and creating safe learning environments. AI tools may assist with developmental assessments and activity planning, but the hands-on nurturing and constant supervision of 3-5 year olds is irreplaceable."

  aiNarrative: "AI image generation is transforming commercial art, but K-12 art education is about developing creativity, fine motor skills, self-expression, and art history appreciation through hands-on studio work. Students need to physically manipulate clay, paint, charcoal, and printmaking tools. AI art tools may become teaching subjects rather than replacements."
  fellowshipOptions: "Master's in Art Education; National Board Certification in Art; museum education specialist; AP Studio Art certification; National Art Education Association leadership; district fine arts coordinator; pathway to college art education faculty"
  compModel: "District salary schedule; small stipends for art shows and after-school clubs; $36K-64K range; some teachers supplement with freelance art sales"
  revPerPatientVisit: "N/A — salaried $36K-$64K/yr based on district salary schedule"
  dailyWorkflow: "Teaching drawing, painting, ceramics, sculpture, digital art, and art history; studio setup and cleanup, kiln management, supply ordering, student portfolio development, art show curation, bulletin board displays"
  patientVolume: "150-300 students across 5-7 class periods; 25-30 per class"
  supportStaffModel: "Usually solo art teacher in building; some schools have art aide for kiln and supply management; district fine arts supervisor evaluates"
  geographicDemandNotes: "Moderate demand — art positions are competitive in suburban districts but available in urban and rural areas; vulnerable to budget cuts; states with arts mandates have more positions"

  aiNarrative: "Physical education is inherently human — demonstrating exercises, refereeing games, supervising safety in the gym and on playing fields. Fitness tracking technology supplements instruction, but motivating students to move, teaching sportsmanship, and managing large groups in physical activity settings cannot be automated. PE teachers also often serve as coaches."
  fellowshipOptions: "Master's in Kinesiology or Physical Education; National Board Certification in Physical Education; adapted PE specialist endorsement; health education endorsement; athletic director pathway; coaching certifications (NFHS); pathway to administration"
  compModel: "District salary schedule; coaching stipends are a major income supplement $3K-10K per sport per season; AD stipend $5K-15K; $38K-66K base range"

  supportStaffModel: "PE department team of 2-3 at larger schools; share gymnasium and fields; athletic trainer collaboration; athletic director oversees sports program"

  aiNarrative: "CTE (Career and Technical Education) covers auto shop, welding, culinary arts, health sciences, IT, and more — all hands-on and project-based. AI may enhance some IT and business curriculum, but the shop-floor supervision, equipment operation, and industry certification preparation require experienced human instructors. Many CTE teachers come from industry with alternative certification."
  fellowshipOptions: "Master's in CTE or Workforce Development; National Board Certification; industry certifications in specialty area (ASE, AWS, ServSafe, CompTIA); CTE department chair; career center director; pathway to CTE district coordinator"
  compModel: "District salary schedule, often with CTE supplement $2K-5K for industry experience; higher starting salary due to industry background requirement; $44K-75K range; some districts match partial industry salary"

  supportStaffModel: "CTE department team; industry advisory board; work-based learning coordinator; shop aide in some programs; Perkins grant coordinator manages federal CTE funding"
  geographicDemandNotes: "High demand nationwide — CTE is expanding rapidly as states invest in career pathways; alternative certification from industry makes entry accessible; strongest in states with robust career academy models (TN, TX, FL, CA)"

  aiNarrative: "AI reading programs can provide adaptive practice and fluency tracking, but diagnosing specific reading disabilities, selecting appropriate interventions, and building reading confidence in struggling students requires expert human judgment. Reading specialists use the science of reading to reach students who have not responded to general classroom instruction — work that demands individualized assessment and relationship."
  fellowshipOptions: "Master's in Reading/Literacy (often required for the role); Reading Specialist certification; International Literacy Association credentials; Orton-Gillingham or Wilson Reading certification; literacy coach; district reading coordinator; pathway to curriculum director"

  supportStaffModel: "Works alongside classroom teachers; coordinates with special education team; reports to building principal or literacy coordinator; paraprofessional aide may assist with lower-tier interventions"

  aiNarrative: "AI tools can accelerate gifted students' learning through personalized pacing, but the social-emotional support gifted learners need — perfectionism counseling, asynchronous development coaching, and intellectual peer community building — requires skilled human facilitation. Gifted specialists also identify underrepresented gifted students and design enrichment that challenges without overwhelming."
  fellowshipOptions: "Master's in Gifted Education; gifted endorsement or certification (state-specific); National Association for Gifted Children credentials; curriculum design specialist; STEM enrichment coordinator; gifted program coordinator; pathway to district gifted director"

  aiNarrative: "AI search tools and digital databases are changing how students research, making information literacy education more important than ever. School librarians who teach students to evaluate sources, detect misinformation, and use AI tools responsibly are increasingly vital. However, budget pressures threaten positions — some districts have eliminated librarian roles, replacing them with aides or digital platforms."
  fellowshipOptions: "Master's in Library Science (MLIS) — often required; school library media specialist certification; National Board Certification in Library Media; technology integration specialist; district library coordinator; pathway to public library director or academic librarianship"
  compModel: "District salary schedule, typically on teacher scale with master's degree lane; $40K-72K range; some districts classify as support staff rather than certified teacher (lower pay)"
