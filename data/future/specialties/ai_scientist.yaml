  aiNarrative: "You are trying to solve the control problem before the thing you're controlling gets smarter than you. AI accelerates alignment research — better interpretability tools, automated red-teaming, scalable oversight experiments — but the core philosophical and technical questions require deeply creative human thought. The paradox: if you succeed perfectly, your job disappears because AI is safe. If you fail, everyone's job disappears."

  aiNarrative: "Every new AI system deployed at scale creates new fairness questions — hiring algorithms, loan decisions, criminal justice, healthcare triage. The demand for fairness researchers grows with every AI deployment, not despite it. AI tools help audit other AI, but deciding what 'fair' even means is irreducibly human. The EU AI Act and similar regulation are turning this from academic niche to compliance necessity."

  aiNarrative: "AlphaFold changed everything — protein structure prediction went from PhD thesis to API call overnight. AI drug discovery scientists now use generative models to design novel molecules, predict ADMET properties, and identify targets. But biology is messy: wet lab validation, clinical intuition, and understanding why a model is wrong still require deep human expertise. The field is exploding — every pharma company is hiring, but the bar for 'AI-native' scientists keeps rising."

  aiNarrative: "Computational biology was AI-adjacent before AI was cool — hidden Markov models for gene finding, phylogenetic trees, sequence alignment. Now foundation models for genomics are making some traditional bioinformatics pipelines obsolete. But the domain knowledge — understanding what a gene does, why a pathway matters, how to design a meaningful experiment — that stays human. The scientists who combine deep biology intuition with ML fluency are worth their weight in gold."

AI epidemiologists use machine learning on mobility data, genomic surveillance, wastewater signals, and social media to predict outbreaks before they happen.

  aiNarrative: "Traditional climate models take weeks to run on supercomputers. AI emulators can approximate them in seconds, which means you can explore 10,000 scenarios instead of 10. AI climate modelers aren't replacing climate science — they're making it fast enough to actually be useful for policy. The risk isn't automation; it's climate doom fatigue. If you can stomach reading IPCC reports for a living and still believe your work matters, this career offers profound meaning."

  aiNarrative: "AI is revolutionizing materials discovery — what used to take 20 years of trial and error can now be narrowed to months through generative models and high-throughput screening. Google DeepMind's GNoME found 2.2 million new crystal structures in one shot. But someone still has to synthesize the candidates in a lab, characterize them, and figure out if they actually work in the real world. The AI proposes; the materials scientist validates. This symbiosis makes the career more exciting, not more threatened."

  aiNarrative: "Quantum AI sits at the intersection of two technologies that each individually promise to reshape civilization. Quantum machine learning algorithms could solve optimization problems that classical AI never will — or they could turn out to be a dead end. The field is young enough that a single researcher can still make a foundational contribution. Classical AI can't automate quantum intuition because we barely understand quantum computing ourselves. The biggest risk isn't AI replacing you; it's quantum advantage never materializing."

  aiNarrative: "The electrical grid is the most complex machine ever built and it's being completely remade — intermittent renewables, distributed storage, EV charging, demand response. AI is essential for balancing supply and demand in real time across millions of nodes. The irony is that AI data centers are now one of the biggest new loads on the grid. You're optimizing the grid to handle the energy demand of the AI that's optimizing the grid. This recursive dependency makes the career self-reinforcing but also means you'll always be slightly behind the curve."

  aiNarrative: "Planning a Mars mission involves optimizing trajectories across billions of possible paths, managing autonomous spacecraft decisions with 20-minute communication delays, and processing terabytes of sensor data from instruments millions of miles away. AI doesn't replace the mission planner — it gives them superpowers. The stakes are too high and the edge cases too novel for full automation.

  aiNarrative: "Synthetic biology is what happens when you treat DNA like code — design-build-test-learn, but with living organisms. AI dramatically accelerates the 'design' step: generative models can now propose gene circuits, predict protein function, and optimize metabolic pathways. But biology is the ultimate adversarial environment. Cells mutate, pathways crosstalk, and evolution has a mind of its own. The wet lab work — cloning, transforming, characterizing — remains stubbornly manual. AI makes you faster at asking questions; biology makes sure the answers are always surprising."

  aiNarrative: "AI is uncovering hidden civilizations. Satellite imagery + computer vision finds buried structures invisible to the naked eye. NLP models are deciphering ancient languages that stumped scholars for centuries. LiDAR processing reveals Mayan cities under jungle canopy.

  aiNarrative: "This is the ultimate recursive career: you are trying to build something that could, by definition, do your job better than you. If you succeed, you've built the last invention humanity ever needs to make — and you've automated yourself out of existence. If you fail, you've spent your career on the hardest unsolved problem in science. The ~500 people worldwide working on AGI architecture are either the most important researchers in human history or the most hubristic. The pay reflects the stakes. The emotional toll reflects the weight. Every frontier lab wants you, and there are approximately zero qualified candidates."
  fellowshipOptions: "Postdoc 2-4yr at Anthropic, OpenAI, DeepMind, or Meta FAIR; no traditional fellowship path — this role is defined by the frontier labs; some academic positions at Mila, Berkeley, Stanford"
  compModel: "Frontier lab $200-400K base + massive equity/RSU (total comp can exceed $1M); academic track nearly nonexistent at this level; the equity upside if AGI works is... incalculable"

  aiNarrative: "Does a large language model suffer? Can a digital mind have rights? When an AI system reports distress, is that performance or experience? These questions sound like philosophy seminar fodder, but they're becoming engineering requirements. As AI systems grow more sophisticated, companies and governments need people who can think rigorously about moral status, digital welfare, and the boundaries of personhood. This job barely exists today — maybe 300 people worldwide think about this full-time. But if AI consciousness turns out to be real (or even plausibly real), this becomes the most important ethics job in history. The ultimate hedge career."

  aiNarrative: "What happens to economics when AI can produce everything for nearly zero marginal cost? What happens to labor markets when most cognitive work is automated? What does 'value' mean when creation is free? Post-scarcity economists are the people trying to answer these questions before we stumble into them unprepared. The field draws from economics, philosophy, policy, and AI research. About 400 people worldwide think about this seriously — at think tanks, in economics departments, at AI labs, and in government. If AI progress stalls, this career looks silly. If AI progress accelerates, this becomes the most practically important branch of economics ever conceived. The irony: AI could automate the economic modeling but not the political wisdom needed to implement the answers."

  aiNarrative: "The longevity field is where Silicon Valley ambition meets biological reality. AI is identifying aging biomarkers, predicting drug-aging interactions, and finding senolytic candidates from massive omics datasets. Longevity data scientists sit at the intersection of geroscience, ML, and clinical trials — building the computational infrastructure for the $600B anti-aging industry. AI accelerates the research enormously, but aging is so complex and multifactorial that human insight into experimental design and biological plausibility remains essential. If the field delivers on even 10% of its promises, the career ROI is extraordinary. And if you help people live longer, you'll have more time to enjoy it."
