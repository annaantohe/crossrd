        - Projected demand (very strong — AI adoption is accelerating across all industries)
        - Impact of demographic changes (growing as older workers reskill)
        - Vulnerability to offshoring (low — domain expertise is often local/regulated)

        - AI impact (positive — AI creates these roles, but better AI may simplify them)
        - AI as tool vs replacement (tool — domain judgment remains essential)
        - Timeline of disruption (moderate — as AI gets easier, less need for translators)
