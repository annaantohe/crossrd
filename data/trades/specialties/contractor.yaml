  aiNarrative: "Electrical contracting is fundamentally hands-on site work — pulling wire, bending conduit, troubleshooting panels. BIM and estimating software help with takeoffs, but the physical installation and code compliance inspection keeps this firmly in human territory. Demand is surging with EV charger and solar panel installations."
  fellowshipOptions: "Master electrician license; electrical administrator license; optional LEED or NABCEP solar certification for specialty work"
  compModel: "Owner draw from net profit; project-based billing at $85-150/hr; some T&M (time and materials) contracts"
  revPerPatientVisit: "$85-150/hr billed per electrician deployed"
  dailyWorkflow: "Job bidding, crew scheduling, permit pulls, site supervision, code compliance, client meetings"
  patientVolume: "3-10 active job sites simultaneously"
  supportStaffModel: "Journeyman electricians, apprentices, office manager, estimator"
  geographicDemandNotes: "Nationwide — high demand in Sun Belt growth markets (TX, FL, AZ) and anywhere with new construction or EV infrastructure buildout"

  aiNarrative: "Plumbing and HVAC contracting involves diagnosing unique building systems, crawling through attics, and working with gas lines and refrigerant — none of which AI can touch. Load calculation software helps with sizing, but the physical installation and emergency service calls are completely automation-proof. Heat pump adoption is driving new demand."
  fellowshipOptions: "Master plumber license; HVAC contractor license; EPA Section 608 certification; optional NATE certification for advanced HVAC specialization"
  compModel: "Owner draw from net profit; service calls billed at $95-175/hr; new construction bid on project basis"

  dailyWorkflow: "Emergency dispatch, new install estimating, crew routing, permit management, equipment ordering, client billing"
  patientVolume: "5-15 active service calls or job sites per day across crew"
  supportStaffModel: "Licensed plumbers, HVAC technicians, apprentices, dispatcher, office admin"

  aiNarrative: "General contracting is the ultimate coordination job — managing 15 different subcontractors, dealing with weather delays, supply chain problems, and inspectors who show up unannounced. AI helps with scheduling and estimating, but walking the job site and managing chaos is purely human. Liability exposure is the bigger career risk than technology."
  fellowshipOptions: "General contractor license (state-specific); optional OSHA 30 certification; CCM (Certified Construction Manager) for larger commercial work"
  compModel: "Owner draw from project profits; typical 8-15% gross margin on projects; income swings with project pipeline"

  aiNarrative: "Superintendents are on the job site every day managing crews, solving problems in real time, and keeping work on schedule. This is one of the most AI-proof roles in the economy — you cannot remotely supervise concrete pours, crane lifts, or safety compliance from a computer. The physical presence requirement is absolute."
  fellowshipOptions: "OSHA 30 certification; CHST (Construction Health and Safety Technician); optional CCM credential for advancement to project executive"
  compModel: "Base salary + project completion bonus (5-15% of base); company truck and phone typically provided"
  revPerPatientVisit: "$0 (salaried position within GC firm)"
  dailyWorkflow: "Daily site walks, crew coordination, safety toolbox talks, schedule updates, subcontractor management, quality inspections"
  patientVolume: "1-3 active job sites (usually dedicated to one large project)"
  supportStaffModel: "Foremen, laborers, subcontractor crews, project engineer, safety officer"
  geographicDemandNotes: "Nationwide — critical shortage of experienced superintendents everywhere; willing to travel or relocate opens up premium positions"

  aiNarrative: "AI-powered scheduling, BIM clash detection, and cost tracking tools are changing how construction managers work, but the core job is people management and on-site decision-making. When a crane delivery is late and three trades are waiting, no algorithm can negotiate the solution. BLS projects 9% growth through 2034."
  fellowshipOptions: "PMP certification; CCM (Certified Construction Manager); LEED AP for green building projects; advancement to VP of operations or company ownership"

  aiNarrative: "Remote video inspections are growing, which is why BLS projects a small decline in this field. But physical site visits to check structural connections, fire stopping, and code compliance still require human eyes and judgment. The role is shifting toward more complex inspections while simple ones get digitized."
  fellowshipOptions: "ICC certifications (residential, commercial, electrical, plumbing, mechanical); Plans Examiner certification; CBO (Certified Building Official) for department leadership"
  compModel: "Government salary with benefits and pension; some private third-party inspection firms pay more but without pension; median $72K per BLS May 2024"

  aiNarrative: "AI-powered takeoff software and BIM-based quantity extraction are automating the tedious parts of estimating — counting doors, measuring drywall, calculating concrete volumes. BLS projects a 4% decline. But complex bids still need human judgment about site conditions, subcontractor reliability, and risk pricing. Senior estimators who understand the 'art' of bidding stay valuable."
  fellowshipOptions: "AACE Certified Cost Professional (CCP); ASPE Certified Professional Estimator (CPE); advancement to chief estimator or preconstruction director"
  compModel: "Base salary + bid-win bonus at some firms; median $77K per BLS May 2024; senior estimators at large GCs earn $100-130K"
